# FortyEight
A robot-scouting web browser program for FIRST Robotics Competition teams created using a webpack-managed React.js framework.

FortyEight is intended to improve upon a prior scouting program 4855scout (https://github.com/FRCTeam4855/4855scout) by retaining its core features (no internet required, data passed from different devices via .json files) while improving various aspects and adding new features including graphs, enhanced UI, and the power of package integration and React.js to make development and updates easier than ever.

## Usage
```
cd FortyEight
npm start
```
